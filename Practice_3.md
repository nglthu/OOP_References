[Lecture Slide 6](https://nglthu.github.io/OOP_References/Slides/Lecture6_LTN.pdf)

[Book](https://nglthu.github.io/Books/java/BruceEckel_Thinking_in_Java_4th_Edition.pdf)

### Code 1: Exercises on the Lecture

1. Create Classes:
+ DisruptLecture.java
+ TestArithmetic.java
+ GlyphTest.java
+ Transmogrify.java


  In the group project under main/java/com/mycompany/app
  
2. Revoke Or Call them in the Main under App.java


### Code 2 : Exercises on [Book](https://nglthu.github.io/Books/java/BruceEckel_Thinking_in_Java_4th_Edition.pdf)
1. Exercise 17 on Polymorphism, page 216
2. Build Abastract Class and extended classes for Orchestra example, on Abstract class, page 220
   The UML as follow:

3. Exercise 21 on Interfaces, page 258 (nested class)

   All exercises should be organised as class and commit under the main/java/com/mycompany/app with their name such as:
   PolymorphismExercise17.java
   Orchestra.java
   InterfacesExercise21.java
   ....

### Code 3: Run code on [W3school](https://www.w3schools.com/java/default.asp) for learning Java Syntax

+ Java Polymorphism
  
[Java Polymorphism](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_polymorphism.asp)  

+ Java Abstraction 
  
[Java Abstraction](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_abstract.asp)



### Code Commit Requirement
+ Organise all codes today under your group repo on Github
  
  Review previous lesson [Setting up a Java project for GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-a-dev-container-configuration/setting-up-your-java-project-for-codespaces)
  
+ Commit all codes under your Github group repo with specific message each commit.
  



### Discuss
+ Any difficulties can send through message to 

[Discussion](https://github.com/nglthu/OOP_References/discussions)
